        <h1>About FarmConnect</h1>
        <p><strong>FarmConnect</strong> is more than just a marketplace — it's a movement to bridge the gap between local farmers and health-conscious consumers. We believe that everyone deserves access to fresh, organic, and sustainably grown food, straight from the source.</p>
        
        <p>Founded with the vision of transforming how communities access and value food, FarmConnect empowers small-scale farmers by giving them direct access to a wider market. Through our platform, farmers receive fair prices for their produce, while customers enjoy high-quality, chemical-free products grown with care.</p>
        
        <p>Our mission is rooted in three core principles: <strong>sustainability</strong>, <strong>community empowerment</strong>, and <strong>transparency</strong>. We actively support eco-friendly farming methods and collaborate with local agricultural groups to ensure long-term environmental and economic impact.</p>

        <p>Whether you're a farmer looking for a fair platform or a consumer passionate about where your food comes from — FarmConnect brings us all together to build a healthier, more connected future.</p>
